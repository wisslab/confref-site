# About ConfRef

In disciplines like computer science (CS), conferences play a key role in the dissemination of scientific results. Conference papers, published in proceedings from publishers like Springer Nature (SN), Elsevier, ACM or IEEE, account for twice as much original research output than journal papers. 

In contrast to journals with ISSNs, however, a central identification of conferences is missing, let alone further data about them. 

The goal of this project is to gather data about conferences from proceedings publishers, conference organizers and other sources and to develop a one-stop pan-publisher place to go for scientists and research evaluators to find information about conferences and to reliably reference conferences via a globally unique persistent ID.
